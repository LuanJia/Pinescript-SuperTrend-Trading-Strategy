# Pinescript SuperTrend Trading Strategy
A trend-following strategy triggering longs &amp; shorts on [Tradingview](https://www.tradingview.com) charts.

The SuperTrend indicator uses Average-True-Range (ATR) to calculate its value. The ATR is a technical analysis indicator that measures market volatility by decomposing the entire range of an asset price for that period. A trend reversal is triggered when a candlestick breaks and closes over/under the prevalent ATR line.
